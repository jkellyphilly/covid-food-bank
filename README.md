# Covid-Food-Bank

This Rails application was built to highlight an important need in today's coronavirus-plagued world: community members who need food should be able to connect with volunteers and vice versa.

This CoVID Community Food Bank application is designed for community members to be able to create a profile on the site and then create delivery requests. Volunteers can sign up to fulfill those requests, which are grouped together as routes. Volunteers can edit the status of a route (marking it as completed, which subsequently will update the statuses of all the individual delivery request within that route, or mark the route as confirmed but not yet completed) or can edit the status of individual deliveries. Both community members and volunteers can leave comments on delivery requests, thus facilitating more communication between the community.

In troubling times, the power of humanity is through community. And community means showing up for neighbors, friends, or complete strangers. This application is my attempt to foster that sense of community.

## Usage

To get the application up and working, run `rails s` from your command line and visit localhost:[port-number] (the port number will be specified after running shotgun).

Sign up for a new member/volunteer profile (or log in if you already have a profile) and then navigate through the site using the hyperlinks in the upper-right-hand corner (home, profile, and log out). Create a new delivery request if you're a member, or edit the statuses of applicable delivery requests/routes if you're a volunteer.
