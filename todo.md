TODO's

* Make a method to get a full list (hash) of items with their "count", then print that out on the route

* Update the CM and Volunteer "directories" to actually have some content on them

* Update the "delete" forms to follow this standard/convention
  - https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v8/module-13-rails/section-6-validations-and-forms/delete-forms

* Maybe all of my helper methods should be snake case and not camelCase

NEXT
* Decide on whether I'm going to enforce strictly moving between statuses, or whether I'll just kind of allow things to work the way they're working now...


-----------------
ASIDE

  It seems like there are definitely some limitations here... for instance, if I want to update a delivery request from a past date, then my current date validation method prevents me from doing that.
