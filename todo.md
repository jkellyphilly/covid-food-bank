TODO's

* Make a method to get a full list (hash) of items with their "count", then print that out on the route

* Update the CM and Volunteer "directories" to actually have some content on them

* Update the "delete" forms to follow this standard/convention
  - https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v8/module-13-rails/section-6-validations-and-forms/delete-forms

* Maybe all of my helper methods should be snake case and not camelCase

NEXT
* Ensure that only applicable delivery requests can have their statuses edited (i.e. if they don't have a route, they can be edited, and can only edit the request if I'm the volunteer who owns the route that it belongs to)
