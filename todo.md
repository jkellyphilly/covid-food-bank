TODO's

* Build comment-functionality; comments are on DeliveryRequest pages ONLY

* Make a method to get a full list (hash) of items with their "count", then print that out on the route

* Update the CM and Volunteer "directories" to actually have some content on them

* Check out the volunteer's routes index page (seems to be not working)

THEN - THIS
* Add in flash error messaging so that I at least know that what I'm doing is working w/ error states
