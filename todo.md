TODO's

* Make a method to get a full list (hash) of items with their "count", then print that out on the route

* Update the CM and Volunteer "directories" to actually have some content on them

* Update the "delete" forms to follow this standard/convention
  - https://learn.co/tracks/full-stack-web-development-v8/module-13-rails/section-6-validations-and-forms/delete-forms

* Maybe all of my helper methods should be snake case and not camelCase

* NOW - Make sure that I can't edit the status of requests 
* NEXT - ensure that when I make a comment from a nested place, I stay on that nested view

NEXT
* Decide on whether I'm going to enforce strictly moving between statuses, or whether I'll just kind of allow things to work the way they're working now...

ASIDE

  It seems like there are definitely some limitations here... for instance, if I want to update a delivery request from a past date, then my current date validation method prevents me from doing that.
